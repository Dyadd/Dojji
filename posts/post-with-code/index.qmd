# On Love

How do you know "I love"? 

In order for I to love anything, I creates an image of the object of love. 

Suppose I say I love my dog and I believe it is true. 

My dog recalls memories within me of our good times together of him being a good boy. 

However, the dog is obviously not my memories of the dog!

The dog right here in front of me is asymptotically not the dog I recall.

Because when I think, it is a thought, the dog right here in front of me is not a thought. 

In fact, calling the dog right here in front of me "the dog right here in front of me" is yet another lie. 

Without "the dog right here in front of me", what is the dog right here in front of me? 

What is this?

What is?

What?

Then love is inevitable.
