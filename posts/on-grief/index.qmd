# On Grief

In order to lose, you must have something. 

But what do you have? 

Perceptually, through labelling, we add 'mine' to what we perceive.

Without learning what is yours, what do you have? 

But without learning what isn't yours, what do you not have? 

Can you own anything you see, anything you hear, anything you taste, anything you smell, anything you think, anything you feel?

Can you own yourself?
